OOP is a programiing paradigm centered around objects rather than functions.
its not a programing language or tool its a paradigm/style
    e.g languages that support OOP

        -C++
        -C#
        -Java
        -JavaScript
        -Ruby

        FrameWorks are built with OOP in mind

OOP 4 Pillars - Polymophism, Abstraction, Encapsulation and Inheritence

Procedural Programming
    programs are divided in a set of functions(methods)

OOP 
    solved the PP problems
    Combines a group of related variables and functions

        class variables = property
        class functions = methods


        E.G Car {
            property : make
            property : color
            property : brand
        }

    Benefits 
        Encapsulation -> Reduce Complexity + increase resuability
        Abstraction -> Reduce Complexity + isole impact of changes
        Inheritence -> Eliminate redundant code 
        Polymophism -> Refactor ugly switch/case statements

    JavaScript is all about Objects
